## General notes

### Communities
* Communities can be large or small, public or private, and your Mukurtu site can have as many communities as needed.
* Each community represents a **group of content contributors** and site users and contains digital heritage items relevant to those community members.
* User access to individual digital heritage items within a community is managed through the use of cultural protocols that are created within the community.
* Some examples of communities could be specific families or clans, tribal government departments, or a space for youth-appropriate content.

### Cultural Protocols
* Each cultural protocol exists within a community, and each community can have multiple cultural protocols.
* Digital heritage items are placed within at least one cultural protocol and can then be viewed by users who are also members of those protocols.
* There are two types of cultural protocols: **open** and **strict**.
  * Digital heritage items within an **open protocol** can be viewed by anyone (including anonymous site visitors).
  * Items within a **strict protocol** can only be viewed by members of that protocol.
* Multiple protocols can be layered to ensure users only view items appropriate for them, providing very granular access. For example, if an item is part of the two strict protocols ‘Women Only’ and ‘Elders Only,’ then only users who are members of both the ‘Women Only’ and ‘Elders Only’ protocols can view that item.
* Some examples of cultural protocols could be gender-based (male only, female only), age-based (elders only, no youth), seasonal access only, clan or tribal affiliation, secret/sacred, community only, or public access/open.

### Categories
* Categories are metadata terms that describe your digital heritage items. They should be broad enough that each item on your site is represented by at least one category and so each category describes many items. For narrower or more specialized terms, consider using keywords. More information about keywords is available in the support article [Using Categories and Keywords](http://support.mukurtu.org/customer/en/portal/articles/2430094-using-categories-and-keywords).
> For example, ‘Fishing’ or ‘Food’ may make good categories as they could apply to a range of items, but ‘salmon’ may not make a good category, as it is likely to only apply to a small number of items.

* Most Mukurtu sites usually have around 10-15 categories, but the categories chosen should reflect the collection and users.
* Some examples of commonly used categories include Lifeways, Education, Lands, Architecture and Dwellings, Language, Ceremony, and Artistry and Artefacts.
